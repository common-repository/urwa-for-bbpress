== Frequently Asked Questions ==

### FAQ

Q: I dragged widgets into the bbPress User Role Widget Areas but they are not showing up on the front end. Why?

A: You must make sure that you have placed the **bbPress Users By Role** widget into any existing **NON-USER** widget area where you want to display specific widgets based on user roles.

Q: I did the step above but the bbPress User Role widgets are still not showing up.

A: Make sure you have at least one widget in the widget area for the role you are logged in as. For example: If you are logged in as an Keymaster drag a text widget into the Users - bbPress Keymaster widget area and give it a title and some placeholder content. Go back to your browser and refresh.
